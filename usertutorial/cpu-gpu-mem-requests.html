<h2 class="h2">Basic of Kubernetes Resource requests</h2>
<h3 class="h3">Disclaimer</h3>
Resource requests are limited and shared among all users. Please be mindful of other users and do not use more resources than you need.
<br/>
For any Kubernetes deployment, you need to specify the amount of CPU, memory, and GPU resources that your container needs. This can be achieved by adding the following fields to your pod spec:
<pre>
  <code>
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
  </code>
</pre>
The above example requests 64MiB of memory, 250 millicores of CPU, and 1 GPU. The GPU request is specific to the NVIDIA GPU plugin.
It is also good idea to specify the limits for your resources. This will prevent your container from using more resources than you need. If you do not specify the limits, your container can use all the resources available on the node. This can lead to resource contention and can affect other users. The following example specifies the limits for the resources:
<pre>
  <code>
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
  </code>
</pre>
The above example specifies the limits for the resources. The container can use up to 128MiB of memory, 500 millicores of CPU, and 1 GPU. The GPU limit is specific to the NVIDIA GPU plugin.
