  <h2 class="h2">What is Harbor?</h2>
  Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, 
  ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.</br>
  </br>
  
  <h2 class="h2">Harbor Administration</h2>
  Harbor supports different modes for authenticating users and managing user accounts. </br>
  <ul>
    <li>Database Authentication</li>
    <li>LDAP/Active Directory authentication</li>
    <li>OIDC Provider Authentication</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="h4">Configuring Authentication</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Log in to the Harbor interface with an account that has Harbor system administrator privileges.</li>
    <li>Under Administration, go to Configuration and select the Authentication tab.</li>
    <li>Select the Auth Mode and click save.</li>
  </ul>
  
  NOTE:</br>
  
  For now we are using Database Authentication and selected Allow Self-Registration. So, users can register themselves in Harbor.</br>
  We are planning to use OIDC Auth-mode in future.
